                <p>
                    I created the idea for 2021 HUEY because of my skating community in Jackson Heights, Queens. Every day in the summer, we would head outside together to the Maloof Skatepark in Flushing Meadows and spend hours perfecting old tricks, learning new techniques, and generally having fun. This community of teens and the occasional child prodigy became my home away from home as we all accepted each other at our lows and highs. However, one underlying, yet extremely pervasive issue surfaced for me that summer in seeing just how many of my peers at the skatepark didn’t have enough money for food to fuel their bodies. If there was some money, we’d split french fries and red bulls between all of us. But doing a sport like skateboarding for hours on end without enough (or the correct) nutrients can be extremely detrimental to one's health over time. I wanted to find a way to help solve this issue that people around me were facing. Especially because this problem was only reflective of the larger issue of food disparity in New York. I thought it unfair that there’s an abundance of access to inexpensive, healthy food in certain neighborhoods and an utter lack of choice in others. So I began to think of ways to solve this in the ways that I knew how.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    In 2022, The Alzar school awarded me a grant to begin working on HUEY, a hydroponics system for my community in Queens that will help local folks get more access to green food. I then enlisted the sponsorship of Google LLC to help continuously fund the purchase or materials and new tech to aid me in this mission. I’ve programmed an app that will aid me in monitoring my plants within my physical hydroponics system from afar using a Raspberry Pi. The app also has an average user interface that allows folks at home to identify the plants growing in their gardens and how to best take care of them. In the coming year, my focus will shift towards the 3D printed construction of my hydroponics towers.

                <p>
                    I love to code for fun and test my knowledge. I’ve found that, even if I’ve taken a course in a coding language, the only way I’ll retain that information is through constant practice, trial, and error.  That’s why I work on fun terminal games like my BitLifeHome (working title)  in my free time. If you’re familiar with the original Bit Life, you’ll understand that this terminal game I’m developing gives a player a fake life story and allows them to move through their little digital world autonomously. You get to make decisions about how to spend your money, who to be friends with, where you work etc. Working on this game has definitely taught me a lot about what I do and do not know about Python (my favorite language). I definitely have a long way to go!

                    Of course, I have to mention this website! This has been the most emotionally charged coding project I’ve worked on so far! Through blood, sweat, and tears, I’m so proud of how this website has turned out. It was my first time purchasing a domain and having my own .com not affiliated with a site like Wix, so that was a particularly exciting milestone for me. The coding in itself has tested me in every way possible (I wasn’t the strongest HTML programmer going into this project), but it also has been the most rewarding project ever. The idea that something that gives me so much grief at times (misplaced commas and brackets have been the bane of my existence recently) could also be something that I’m so utterly committed to has only proven to me further that Computer Science is the field for me. I’m going to keep building this website into the foreseeable future, and I’m excited for the challenges it’ll throw my way. But I’m going to keep on going because this is what I love and it's therapeutic to see the fruits of my hard labor.

            For my 2023-2024 school year, I am being endorsed by the Chapin School Individual Study Committee to film, produce, and edit a documentary on the subject of cybersecurity. My thesis question, which has been posed alongside other supplemental questions to my interviewees in the professional cybersecurity community, is “Should we trust our computers, and why?”. I aim to uncover the ins and outs of the cybersecurity professional (and pre-professional) community for audiences who may know little to nothing about this rapidly growing industry. 
         </p>
         <p class="hidden-paragraph" id="paragraphD">
            So far, I’ve been able to interview leading specialists, entrepreneurs, and developers who have been enlisted by government agencies for their talents. However, I’m still in the search for interviewees! If you or anyone you know loves to talk about what they do in CyberSec, please have them contact me at ifeayobakare@gmail.com. I would love to speak with them!

        <p class="hidden-paragraph" id="paragraphSS">
            In response to an assignment prompt during my 11th-grade American Experience class, I chose to create a visual, music-documentary-style representation of my life's journey. I elected to use "Downtown" by Godford as the backing track for this short film—a house song that has recently played a significant role in my exploration of new music and has been central to my life for an extended period. You may have already found my Song of Self video at the center of the MyArts page on this website, but you may also view it on Youtube at this link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N53G52lOBTw"></a> 
Beneath my video on YouTube, you will find this description highlighting the significance of certain moments in the film.

            "Little fish in big ponds are bound to become big fish in little ponds eventually." 
This is what my mother told me before I began my first year of high school. She wanted to calm my nerves about the transition. What was strange to me was hearing my life laid out and summed up for me in such simple terms. She reminded me that each insurmountable task and daunting change that life has presented to me, I've been able to overcome with time. Usually, I don't even notice that I've fought my fears because I'm already onto the next task. 
My mother reminded me that the fears I have will fade. The feeling of being lost in bigger, newer, more exciting crowds will also fade as I get to know the people around me. I'll soon be like the big fish in the little pond of high school. From there, the cycle will only repeat if I continue to push myself toward growth, learning, and the experience of life.   
Next year, I'm off to college. I know the cycle will soon refresh. I'm posting this now to remind myself of the excitement that can come with being the little fish in a brand new environment. There is so much life to live in these types of places and so much space to grow.

            My first passion has always been language and literature. In fact, the poetry of code is partially how I connect with Computer Science to the extent that I do. However, during my earlier childhood, I dreamed of being an author / veteranarian / president... but mainly an author. Here's a quick look into my life as a writer!
