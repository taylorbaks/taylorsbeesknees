                <h1 style="color: white;"> HUEY - Swift </h1>
                <p>
                    I created the idea for 2021 HUEY because of my skating community in Jackson Heights, Queens. Every day in the summer, we would head outside together to the Maloof Skatepark in Flushing Meadows and spend hours perfecting old tricks, learning new techniques, and generally having fun. This community of teens and the occasional child prodigy became my home away from home as we all accepted each other at our lows and highs. However, one underlying, yet extremely pervasive issue surfaced for me that summer in seeing just how many of my peers at the skatepark didn’t have enough money for food to fuel their bodies. If there was some money, we’d split french fries and red bulls between all of us. But doing a sport like skateboarding for hours on end without enough (or the correct) nutrients can be extremely detrimental to one's health over time. I wanted to find a way to help solve this issue that people around me were facing. Especially because this problem was only reflective of the larger issue of food disparity in New York. I thought it unfair that there’s an abundance of access to inexpensive, healthy food in certain neighborhoods and an utter lack of choice in others. So I began to think of ways to solve this in the ways that I knew how.

                    In 2022, The Alzar school awarded me a grant to begin working on HUEY, a hydroponics system for my community in Queens that will help local folks get more access to green food. I then enlisted the sponsorship of Google LLC to help continuously fund the purchase or materials and new tech to aid me in this mission. I’ve programmed an app that will aid me in monitoring my plants within my physical hydroponics system from afar using a Raspberry Pi. The app also has an average user interface that allows folks at home to identify the plants growing in their gardens and how to best take care of them. In the coming year, my focus will shift towards the 3D printed construction of my hydroponics towers.

            My first passion has always been language and literature. In fact, the poetry of code is partially how I connect with Computer Science to the extent that I do. However, during my earlier childhood, I dreamed of being an author / veteranarian / president... but mainly an author. Here's a quick look into my life as a writer!
